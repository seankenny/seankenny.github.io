    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Today I upgraded to node 0.10.15 and just ran npm install on a project I am working on.  I started seeing a lot of these failures:</p>

<pre><code>npm - ERR! registry error parsing json
npm - ERR! SyntaxError: Unexpected token &lt;
</code></pre>

<p>I had already run the npm install command maybe 30 minutes previously so I thought it might be something to do with the node/npm versions so I did the usual and rolled back.  Same issue.  Ok so maybe a corrupt module or something?  <code>npm cache clean</code> was next.  Still no change.</p>

<!--more-->


<p>Ok so what the heck is going on?  Looking a bit more closely showed that npm appeared to be setting the mime type to html on the reponse.  Hang on &ndash; the npm registry does not return html.  So somewhere along the line a proxy or some other intermediary was setting the type.</p>

<p>Anyway, long story short &ndash; reboot of the laptop and we were back in business.  I can only guess that, with the various upgrade installs and some other tasks I was running, something caused this mess.</p>

<p>Just one of those things.</p>
